#xpath-analyzer

Google Chrome extension that allows to evaluate xPath expressions against the XML of the current browser tab.

##xpath-analyzer in a nutshell
xPath Analyzer allows to evaluate xPath/XSLT expressions against the XML of the current browser tab. 
It works well also if third parties extensions (like [XML Tree] [1]) are installed.

**xPath Analyzer has not other dependencies.**

It is really simple to use:
 - paste (or write) a new xPath in the input field, and simply press enter to evaluate the expression.

xPath Analyzer can evaluate each possible type of xPath (or XSLT expression).
